In this video we are going to set up our repository on Github
and connect that repository to Netlify.


We can place our files in our Github repository using the
interface on the Github website, or we can do this using the
terminal.

I am going to walk through both processes in this video.


You should have:


1. Set up a Github account

2. Set up a Netlify account

2. Starter files downloaded and pulled up in your editor
